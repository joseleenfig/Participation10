    <h2>My Font</h2>
    For the font I created using the website metaflop, I created a simple bold font. 
    I am using something that looks italic and bold at the same time, for style and also 
    to stand out. <br>I like the look of the font tilting a bit to show its difference in the 
    rest of the fonts. I used the optical corrections to situate the corners, overshoot and taper. 
    I also increase the contrast, slanting, and superness <br>for the shape of the text. 
    The proportion  of my text was also increases, I used the cap height and bar height.
    Although I am having trouble linking my new font, that is mostly what I liked about the simple new font I made.
